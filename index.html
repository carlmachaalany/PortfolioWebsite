                We as students are facing a problem that keeps appearing at the beginning of every semester: we find it difficult to find
                Messenger group chats for our courses, and students go wild on Facebook groups to find a group member who can send them 
                an invitation for the chat as Facebook now disabled the function where people can join a chat via a link. Sometimes students
                are never added to their class group chat until midterm or later in the semester. <br>

                That's why we came up with McUnity! By using only your Mcgill and FB accounts, McUnity is an app that will fetch your registered
                courses for the coming semester and directly add you to all Messenger groups that you're looking for. With McUnity, you can also
                make meaningful connections with other students!  
                </p>

                The problem this app addresses initially seems like an obvious one: fire alarms are pretty ineffective when it comes to 
                those with hearing loss. This is why we were surprised when we found out that this problem had never been fully addressed.
                 Apart from those with hearing impairment, studies show that nearly 50% of fatal residential fires occur between 10 pm and
                6 am, usually when people are in deep sleep. So not only is fire alarm notification a problem for those who are hearing
                impaired, but even for people who are just sleeping. <br>
                SmartAlert uses a FFT (Fast Fourier transform) to detect nearby fire alarms and notifies the user via strong vibrations and flashlight blinks.<br>
